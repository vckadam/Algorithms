Rearrange an array such that ‘arr[j]’ becomes ‘i’ if ‘arr[i]’ is ‘j’
Given an array of size n where all elements are in range from 0 to n-1, change contents of arr[] so that arr[i] = j is changed to arr[j] = i.

Examples:

Example 1:
Input: arr[]  = {1, 3, 0, 2};
Output: arr[] = {2, 0, 3, 1};
Explanation for the above output.
Since arr[0] is 1, arr[1] is changed to 0
Since arr[1] is 3, arr[3] is changed to 1
Since arr[2] is 0, arr[0] is changed to 2
Since arr[3] is 2, arr[2] is changed to 3

Example 2:
Input: arr[]  = {2, 0, 1, 4, 5, 3};
Output: arr[] = {1, 2, 0, 5, 3, 4};

Example 3:
Input: arr[]  = {0, 1, 2, 3};
Output: arr[] = {0, 1, 2, 3};

Example 4:
Input: arr[]  = {3, 2, 1, 0};
Output: arr[] = {3, 2, 1, 0};
